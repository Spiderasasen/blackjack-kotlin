# blackjack-kotlin
Getting a feel for Kotlin by programming blackjack. 

# Why programming in  Kotlin
I got a buddy of mine who programmed the new hit game called World War Chess, WWC. He added a dev lounge area where people can just program in anything in Java (JFrame), but told me that i can add Kotlin, and that he is more than happy to add it. 
So I did something in Java to prove i can get a better understanding of JFrame, i don't get it still, but i really do want to make a mobile app someday.

# Kotlin only Android
I understand that, and honestly, that's fine, it's more going to be used when i make the app, will might be used for myself or others if they want.

# so why blackjack?
I need to learn this language before going into difficult coding segments
